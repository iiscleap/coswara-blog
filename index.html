Project Coswara is an experimental study to evaluate the possibility for COVID-19 diagnosis using computer based analysis of respiratory sounds, namely, breath, cough and speech samples collected using a smartphone. The research and the understanding of the novel virus and COVID-19 is a work in progress at various laboratories around the world. The [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_3) and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) have listed dry cough, difficulty in breathing, chest pain (or pressure), and loss of smell or taste as key symptoms of this viral infection, visible between 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Further, a recent modeling study by [Menni et. al.] (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0916-2) of symptoms data collected from a pool of 7178 COVID-19 positive individuals validated the presence of these symptoms. Medical literature shows that speech breathing patterns are intricately tied to changes in anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system. Drawn by these observations, we identify an opportunity to make an impact on point-of-care diagnosis using speech and acoustics research. Bringing together a large dataset of respiratory sounds, machine learning, and respiratory infection expertise from doctors can help in evaluating the potential of using sound samples for diagnosis of COVID-19. The goal is not to replace the existing chemical testing methodologies but to supplement them with cost effective, fast and simpler techniques for pre-screening of Covid-19. As we learn more about this, once in a while we will try to post updates here.
