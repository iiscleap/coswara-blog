[Project Coswara](http://coswara.iisc.ac.in/) is launched to evaluate the effectiveness in COVID-19 diagnosis using respiratory sound samples. The idea is to use digital technology to analyze breath, cough, and speech samples collected using a smartphone to detect respiratory ailments including COVID-19.

* Reasoning: Medical literature shows that speech breathing patterns are intricately tied to changes in anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system. The [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_3) and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) have listed dry cough, difficulty in breathing, chest pain (or pressure), and loss of smell or taste as key symptoms of this viral infection, visible between 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Further, a recent modeling study by [Menni et. al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0916-2) of symptoms data collected from a pool of 7178 COVID-19 positive individuals validated the presence of these symptoms.
* Goal: a) To publish a large dataset of respiratory sounds, (b) design signal processing and machine learning techniques to analyze the dataset to detect respiratory infections, and (c) augment expertise from doctors for remote diagnosis of respiratory infections.
* Note: The goal is not to replace the existing COVID-19 chemical testing methodologies but to supplement them with cost effective, fast and simpler techniques for pre-screening of Covid-19.

This blog will share our journey in this project. We will try to make posts as and when we find something interesting to share from this work.
