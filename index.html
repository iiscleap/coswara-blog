A sound can trigger a lot in your mind, and if it is a human sound, you begin to infer - do you know the person, what is s/he saying, the personality, health status, etc. Drawn by the information packed nature of sound signals, [Project Coswara (www.coswara.iisc.ac.in)](www.coswara.iisc.ac.in) is launched to evaluate its effectiveness for COVID-19 diagnosis. The idea is to collect and analyze breath, cough, and speech samples using digital technology and techniques in machine learning for detecting respiratory ailments, including COVID-19. We do not know if we will succeed in this but it is worth a try, and to us, now looks the right time to give it a shot. We are a team of engineers, scientists, and medical doctors.

* *Reasoning:* The sound, or air pressure variation, coming out from our mouth and nose is intricately tied to changes in anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system. The [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_3) lists dry cough, difficulty in breathing, and chest pain as key symptoms of COVID-19, visible between 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. 
* *Goals:* *a)* To publish a large dataset of respiratory sound samples, *(b)* design signal processing and machine learning techniques to analyze and detect respiratory infections, and *(c)* augment expertise from doctors for remote diagnosis of respiratory infections using respiratory sound samples.
* *Note:* We do not intend to replace the existing COVID-19 chemical testing methodologies but to supplement them with cost effective, fast and simpler techniques for pre-screening of Covid-19.

This blog will share our journey in this project. We will try to make posts as and when we find something worth sharing from this work. This can sometimes also include tutorials for sound processing. Meanwhile, if you haven't yet contributed to the database of sound samples, you can do so by going to [this](www.coswara.iisc.ac.in) link. It only takes 5-7 mins. Please do spread the word too ;).
