    "We are in the process of obtaining sound activity annotations for every sound file in the COSWARA database via human listening. Below is some analysis of the 286 annotated sound files. An example of annotations is shown below. The blue shade corresponds to the human annotation. The red trace corresponds to intensity obtained from PRAAT.\n",
